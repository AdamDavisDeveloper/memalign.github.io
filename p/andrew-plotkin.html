My interest in interactive fiction and simple-yet-vast personal websites intersected this week when I stumbled upon <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Plotkin">Andrew Plotkin</a>'s <a href="https://eblong.com/zarf/home.html">homepage</a> (aka Zarfhome).<br />
<br />
(My previous adventures have led me to Drew's <a href="/p/clamps.html">clamps</a>, Lawrence's <a href="/p/coding-machines.html">coding machines</a>, and Eric Meyer's heartbreaking posts about his daughter <a href="/p/rebecca-meyer.html">Rebecca</a>.)<br />
<br />
Andrew has done some really cool work over the years. His body of work includes foundational tools for <a href="https://eblong.com/zarf/glk/index.html">building</a>/<a href="https://eblong.com/zarf/blorb/index.html">packaging</a> interactive fiction games and an impressive library of <a href="https://eblong.com/zarf/if.html">interactive fiction games</a>.<br />
<br />
Zarfhome's design aesthetic of black text, blue links, and a white background may not be enticing to everybody browsing the web these days. When I see a site like this, I'm drawn in. This is where the special gems on the internet still exist.<br />
<br />
Here are some notable pages to check out:<br />
<br />
- The <a href="https://eblong.com/zarf/home.html">homepage</a><br />
<br />
- The <a href="https://eblong.com/zarf/sitemap.html">sitemap</a> where he lists decades of projects<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- He even made an interactive-fiction-style <a href="https://eblong.com/zarf/cave/index.html">caves version</a> of the sitemap. What a clever idea!<br />
<br />
- A years-out-of-date <a href="https://eblong.com/zarf/changes.html">changes</a> page. When I see this, I think about how much more durable this is than posts on Facebook or Twitter. There's something special about this kind of website that we don't get in today's social media.<br />
<br />
- <a href="https://blog.zarfhome.com">Andrew's blog</a><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- This is what led me to the homepage in the first place<br />
<br />
<br />
As I browsed, I had a few neat surprises:<br />
<br />
- Over a decade ago, I downloaded a Python program called <a href="https://github.com/erkyrath/boodler">Boodler</a> to make soundscapes. It turns out Andrew made Boodler!<br />
<br />
- I had stumbled upon "Crazy Uncle Zarf"'s <a href="http://pr-if.org/doc/play-if-card/play-if-card-300dpi.png">handy interactive fiction reference card</a> when I was getting started playing IF. It turns out Andrew wrote this too!<br />
<br />
- Up until now, I hadn't seen other examples of blending richer interactive fiction with a web/mobile-friendly hyperlink interface like I recently experimented with in <a href="/p/dungeon-memalign.html">Dungeon Memalign</a>. I found that Andrew did some work like this back in 2012! His game, <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/collections/yuletide2012/works/598023">Bigger Than You Think</a>, is played by clicking hyperlinks and picking up items.<br />
<br />
<br />
Andrew's decades of work, shared through his site with the world, are truly inspiring. It's so cool that he's shared complete projects, half-baked prototypes, random ideas, and more. Thank you Andrew!<br />

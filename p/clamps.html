Many years ago, I stumbled upon some cool personal websites made by software engineers back in the 1990s/early-2000s.<br />
<br />
I liked the websites because they shared interesting projects, essays, stories, and pictures. Some of them peppered in personality and humor unique to the author.<br />
<br />
In a way, they inspired me to eventually make this website.<br />
<br />
A simple yet intruiging post was about clamps. You can find my backup of the page <a href="/m/clamps/index.html">here</a>.<br />
<br />
It's got some humor (including that poor Pillsbury doughboy) and it opened my eyes to how handy clamps can be around the home and office. (By the way, I also find binder clips and zip ties to be useful fasteners for quick projects/fixes!)<br />
<br />
This is a glimpse into a more fun era of the web.<br />
<br />
The author eventually took the website down and replaced it with a much more professional one. Normally I would give full attribution but since he removed all the content, I decided to scrub his full name and web address from this post and my backup of the page. I'm assuming he intentionally wants to have a less personal presence on the web. (Drew, if you want attribution or want me to remove this post, please let me know via GitHub.)<br />

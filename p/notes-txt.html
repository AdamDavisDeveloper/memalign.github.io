At a software engineering internship in 2006, my mentor told me that he kept a paper engineering journal that he put notes in every day as he worked on problems. He gave me one, too. I followed that habit during all of my internships.<br />
<br />
Then ~4 years later, I started working as a full-time software engineer. A few months into working, I stopped using a paper notebook. I think part of the reason is that I had a better tool: the bug tracker. Pretty much every assignment I got had a corresponding entry in a bug tracking database. I started keeping the notes of my investigations in bug reports directly so there would be a central and shared source of truth. A mentor at this job said "some of the best engineers" put frequent clear updates in their bugs.<br />
<br />
My personal projects had always been note-free, though. Unfortunately, I didn't bring the same problem-solving-and-knowledge-capturing discipline to personal projects until ~2016. That's a whole decade after learning the value of an engineering journal at work!<br />
<br />
Now, even for informal personal projects, I keep a notes.txt file in the <a href="/p/source-control.html">git repository</a>. <br />
<br />
Here's an excerpt from notes.txt for this website (which is a personal side-project of its own):<br />
<br />
<div id='code'>12/25/19<br />
<br />
I created a user page in github!<br />
<br />
I found that I have to publish from the master branch and the root directory of the memalign.github.io project. I also found that an index.html file with just plaintext contents wouldn&#039;t get served for https://memalign.github.io<br />
<br />
( I figured this out by googling and finding:<br />
https://github.community/t5/GitHub-Pages/index-html-not-working/td-p/1266 )</div>
(You can see the full notes.txt for the project <a href="/notes.txt">here</a>.)<br />
<br />
I use notes.txt to capture:<br />
<br />
- Problems I'm running into<br />
- Thoughts on what might be happening<br />
- Potential solutions to explore<br />
- The solution that worked<br />
- Useful links and other research<br />
- Useful commands<br />
- The full steps required to do something novel (for example: getting a 3rd party open source library to build and install correctly)<br />
- Features I want to add<br />
- The bug list<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- For a simple side-project a text bug list embedded in my notes is much easier than a full bug tracker

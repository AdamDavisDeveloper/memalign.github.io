Browsing interesting personal websites is often fun (as in <a href="/p/clamps.html">clamps</a> and <a href="/p/coding-machines.html">Coding Machines</a>). But sometimes it can break your heart.<br />
<br />
That's the case with <a href="https://meyerweb.com/ui/about.html">Eric Meyer</a>'s open grieving after losing a child. I found his website when I learned about <a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2014/06/19/rebeccapurple/">rebeccapurple</a>, a special color added to the CSS specification as a tribute to his daughter. As I read his family's experiences, I found myself crying and feeling an aching pain for these people I've never met.<br />
<br />
Eric shared his experiences as they happened. You can find them <a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/category/personal/rebecca/?order=asc">here</a>. His family's story is tragic and emotional and wonderfully written.<br />
<br />
(I normally try to keep a backup of external sites but I'm not grabbing one here. I want to be respectful of Eric and his family's potential future choices to remove their story.)<br />

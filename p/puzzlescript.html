<a href="https://www.puzzlescript.net/">PuzzleScript</a> is a way to make tile-based games that run on the web. It was <a href="https://www.puzzlescript.net/Documentation/about.html">created</a> by <a href="https://www.increpare.com/">increpare</a>.<br />
<br />
An interesting tidbit from the <a href="https://www.puzzlescript.net/Documentation/credits.html">credits</a> page: PuzzleScript's creator is/was flatmates with <a href="https://terrycavanaghgames.com/">Terry Cavanagh</a>, who made a bunch of popular and creative games: <a href="http://thelettervsixtim.es/">VVVVVV</a>, <a href="http://superhexagon.com/">Super Hexagon</a>, and (my favorite) <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dont-look-back/id568668228">Don't Look Back</a>.<br />
<br />
The PuzzleScript games I've seen usually have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban">Sokoban</a> elements: pushing/moving crates to solve puzzles. The wrong moves can make a level unbeatable so another core element of PuzzleScript games is unlimited undo by pressing 'z'. Explore the <a href="https://www.puzzlescript.net/Gallery/index.html">gallery</a> and check out increpare's <a href="https://www.increpare.com/">portfolio of games</a>.<br />

<h3>Notable Games</h3><br />

<a href="https://www.puzzlescript.net/play.html?p=d210a5248fa713153950"><img src="/m/puzzlescript/sokoboros/sokoboros.gif"></a><br />
<h4><a href="https://www.puzzlescript.net/play.html?p=d210a5248fa713153950">Sokoboros</a></h4> (<a href="/m/puzzlescript/sokoboros/index.html">backup</a>)<br />
I enjoyed this game the most. Sokoboros combines elements of Sokoban and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)">Snake</a>. The game's name is a clever pun that combines "Sokoban" and "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouroboros">Ouroboros</a>"!<br />
<br />

<h4><a href="https://www.puzzlescript.net/play.html?p=6994394">Atlas Shrank</a></h4> (<a href="/m/puzzlescript/atlasshrank/index.html">backup</a>)<br />
I enjoyed this game where you play as the Greek Titan <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_(mythology)">Atlas</a> who has been shrunken down and needs to escape a series increasingly complex of rooms.<br />

This <a href="https://pixelverse.org/files/06c9d85eae32d864c4788e40a1882614-10.html">Zelda-inspired</a> game is made by <a href="https://pixelverse.org/">Joshua Minor</a>. Joshua's <a href="http://twitter.com/jminor">twitter</a> feed has led me to many interesting projects and ideas, including PuzzleScript and <a href="/p/pico8.html">PICO-8</a>! If not for him, these posts wouldn't exist. According to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshua-minor-972851">LinkedIn</a>, Joshua's been an engineer at Pixar for 21 years at the time of writing. How cool!<br />

<h4><a href="https://www.puzzlescript.net/play.html?p=11358856">Collapse</a></h4> (<a href="/m/puzzlescript/collapse/index.html">backup</a>)<br />
Terry Cavanagh made this game. I'm reminded slightly of <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dont-look-back/id568668228">Don't Look Back</a>: the main character is navigating a hellish and dangerous world to retrieve something beautiful.<br />

<h4><a href="https://www.puzzlescript.net/play.html?p=6846450">Love and Pieces</a></h4> (<a href="/m/puzzlescript/loveandpieces/index.html">backup</a>)<br />
Love and Pieces is made by Lexaloffle / Zep, the creator of <a href="/p/pico8.html">PICO-8</a>!<br />

<h3>Some Technical Details</h3><br />
<br />
PuzzleScript <a href="https://github.com/increpare/PuzzleScript">source code</a> (<a href="/m/puzzlescript/puzzlescript.zip">backup</a>) reveals some cool details:<br />
- PuzzleScript has its own web-based <a href="https://www.puzzlescript.net/editor.html?hack=6994394">code editor</a>. I particularly like how it displays colors for the sprite pixels defined in text.<br />
- Instead of hosting its own database of games, it integrates with GitHub's gist API. Every game is just stored in a gist in a user's GitHub account. For example, Atlas Shrank's gist is <a href="https://api.github.com/gists/6994394">here</a>. This is an interesting and clever way to avoid hosting your own server.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- The code to post a new gist can be found in the shareClick function <a href="https://github.com/increpare/PuzzleScript/blob/master/src/js/toolbar.js">here</a>.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- The code to load a gist can be found in the getData function <a href="https://github.com/increpare/PuzzleScript/blob/master/src/play.html">here</a>.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- play.html loads whatever gist id is appended to the url (which looks like: <a href="https://www.puzzlescript.net/play.html?p=6994394">https://www.puzzlescript.net/play.html?p=6994394</a>)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- I think there's a risk loading content this way: it could look like the website owner published content when really it was published by someone else. The content could be offensive or harmful. To mitigate this, if I use this technique in a project I will probably show a disclaimer on the website that this content is from an external user with a direct link to that user's gist.

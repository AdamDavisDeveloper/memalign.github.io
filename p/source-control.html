It's smart to have backups of important information. The best way to have backups for programming projects is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control">source control</a>.<br />
<br />
I've used source control (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git">git</a>, specifically) for personal programming projects, professional software development, journals, and websites. It works well for anything text-based.<br />
<br />
Source control is super useful because it tracks incremental history of changes. That makes it easy to hone in on when a change (good or bad) was made with some context of why. That's useful when tracking down a nasty bug! It's also useful when researching why specific design decisions were made.<br />
<br />
<br />
Some helpful options to get started with source control:<br />
<br />
- Use <a href="https://github.com">https://github.com</a> to create and host repositories for free<br />
<br />
- Another free option is <a href="https://bitbucket.org/product">Bitbucket</a><br />
<br />
- Create your own local git repository that lives directly on your computer. Learn more <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Appendix-C%3A-Git-Commands-Getting-and-Creating-Projects">here</a>.<br />
<br />
<br />
Because code can often be reused, I recommend using git for nearly all the code you ever write. It's even useful to have a git repository that's just for small utilities or toying around. Use a local git repository if you want to keep it private.<br />
<br />
You can find my own public GitHub repositories <a href="https://github.com/memalign/">here</a>.

I've had the Beatles on my mind recently thanks to the buzz around Peter Jackson's "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles:_Get_Back">The Beatles: Get Back</a>" documentary.<br />
<br />
I grew up long after the Beatles had broken up and I had never listened to a full Beatles album despite liking a lot of their songs. I decided to listen to every album in order, looking up interesting details about the albums and songs on Wikipedia along the way. (I wish there were more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop-Up_Video">pop-up videos</a>!)<br />
<br />
I now have a lot more appreciation for the Beatles members as people, how hard-working they were, and how their music evolved.<br />
<br />
Here are my Beatles picks (in no particular order). Many of these songs are so popular that I already knew them; others I heard for the first time during this listen-through. I left off some songs (Hey Jude, Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds, and many more) that are objectively good but that I don't like enough to consider "my picks". Some of these songs are funny (such as Norwegian Wood, Michelle, Girl (how a pained John Lennon sucks in air through his teeth), Getting Better), some are just fun, and others are among the most beautiful songs I've ever heard.<br />

<p>I love clamps because they make it so easy to stick things together
temporarily, and they don't leave behind an annoying residue like duct
tape does.</p>

<p>For example, here are some shadow cards I&nbsp;constructed at work out
of black foam core. They keep direct sunlight from the skylights off my
monitor. The shadow cards are held up by supports made entirely of clamps.</p>

<p>Those little orange hand clamps they have at the hardware store are
especially cool, and they're relatively cheap.</p>

<p>I've been collecting clamps since college, and now I have about a dozen
different kinds.</p>

<p>Clamps are essentially Lego for adults.</p>

<p>The wackiest clamp I have seen so far is called 
the <a href=".">Auggie Gripper</a>. From 
the web site it looks like
it's at least two feet long. It appears to be a pretty serious
clamp. I think it's intended
primarily for clamping together equipment in hospitals.
However, I also get the impression it could be used 
for connecting slippery zoo animals to each other
or uniting disparate elements of our nation's political system.</p>

Also, check out my excellent web page about <a href=".">glue</a>!

I created a user page in github!

I found that I have to publish from the master branch and the root directory of the memalign.github.io project. I also found that an index.html file with just plaintext contents wouldn't get served for https://memalign.github.io
(I figured this out by googling and finding:
https://github.community/t5/GitHub-Pages/index-html-not-working/td-p/1266
)

Testing editing the note from my iPad.

I'm going to try to publish generate HTML (and an RSS feed) using some hopefully simple JavaScript I can write in the Scriptable app.

I need to give Scriptable the ability to read and write files in this git repo and I'm able to do that in Scriptable's in-app settings by creating a file bookmark. I added one for the top-level directory of this repo and named it "memalign.github.io".

Ok, that's working well and I seem to have the primitives I need to be able to read files and write output files.

Is it possible to add the script code itself to the github repo?

Ah, I think I can have the script copy its own contents over from iCloud documents directory to the github repo.

Ok, I have a crude verson of this working.

Task list:

[x] - Need a test entry 

- Need to convert entries in the entries subdirectory into standalone html pages

- Need a stylesheet that can apply to all pages

- Need a landing index.html page that links to all entries and might show the most recent few? Probably an Index class

- Need to flesh out the format of an entry (date, optional image(s), title, html filename, etc)

- Entry HTML pages should specify the right opengraph values, such as image link

- Need to generate an RSS feed

- For images, I need to figure out how to strip location and any other sensitive EXIF metadata


Some thoughts on entry format:
- Filename like #####-post-name.txt
- The file should start with "Title: " and "Date: MM/DD/YYYY"
- Entry text follows

I could make an Entry class for parsing these. It can have methods for outputting an HTML file, the RSS content, etc. I think I'll want to sort them based on the number the filename starts with.

I think it would be good to put generated post html files into a "p" subdirectory so the root of the repo doesn't get too messy.

I created a user page in github!

I found that I have to publish from the master branch and the root directory of the memalign.github.io project. I also found that an index.html file with just plaintext contents wouldn't get served for https://memalign.github.io
(I figured this out by googling and finding:
https://github.community/t5/GitHub-Pages/index-html-not-working/td-p/1266
)

Testing editing the note from my iPad.

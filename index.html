Welcome to memalign.github.io!<br />
<br />
I made this website so I have a place to post ideas and projects.<br />
<br />
I'm creating my own website instead of posting on Facebook or Twitter with the hope that it'll be more durable and discoverable long-term.<br />
<br />
I also hope that this website will be simpler than maintaining some kind of blog.<br />
<br />
<br />
About me:<br />
- I live in California. I moved here for a software engineering job after graduating college<br />
- I'm married to a beautiful and intelligent woman who works as an attorney<br />
- We have a Shiba Inu who brings us a lot of joy

***TODO: write a real entry here***

Notes.txt is very useful. I keep one for all of my personal projects.

Here's an example note for the side-project that is the website you're reading now:

[Code]
12/25/19

I created a user page in github!

I found that I have to publish from the master branch and the root directory of the memalign.github.io project. I also found that an index.html file with just plaintext contents wouldn't get served for https://memalign.github.io

( I figured this out by googling and finding:
https://github.community/t5/GitHub-Pages/index-html-not-working/td-p/1266 )
[/Code]

(You can see the full notes.txt for the project [Link:/notes.txt]here[/Link].)

Title: Clamps

Many years ago, I stumbled upon some cool personal websites made by software engineers back in the 1990s/early-2000s.

I liked the websites because they shared interesting projects, essays, stories, and pictures. Some of them peppered in personality and humor unique to the author.

In a way, they inspired me to eventually make this website.

A simple yet intruiging post was about clamps. You can find my backup of the page [Link:/m/clamps/index.html]here[/Link].

It's got some humor (including that poor Pillsbury doughboy) and it opened my eyes to how handy clamps can be around the home and office. (By the way, I also find binder clips and zip ties to be useful fasteners for quick projects/fixes!)

This is a glimpse into a more fun era of the web.

The author eventually took the website down and replaced it with a much more professional one. Normally I would give full attribution but since he removed all the content, I decided to scrub his full name and web address from this post and my backup of the page. I'm assuming he intentionally wants to have a less personal presence on the web. (Drew, if you want attribution or want me to remove this post, please let me know via GitHub.)

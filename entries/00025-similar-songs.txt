I like listening to music. I like it even more when I discover connections between songs.

It's cool to find out that a song is a cover of another song or that it contains samples of other songs.

[Link:https://whosampled.com]WhoSampled.com[/Link] is a useful resource to find these connections. Rap songs in particular often contain a bunch of samples! Try searching for your favorites.

Update 12/26/21: See also my [Link:/p/soundsjustlike.html]follow-up post[/Link] about another resource for finding similar songs. See my complete up-to-date list of similar songs [Link:/m/similarsongs.html]here[/Link].

Friend's eulogy for his father

https://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/01/10/watch-your-thoughts/

Watch your thoughts, they become words;
watch your words, they become actions;
watch your actions, they become habits;
watch your habits, they become character;
watch your character, for it becomes your destiny.

Frank Outlaw


This is similar to what Iâ€™m trying to say with the poem. Thinking envious thoughts leads to envious actions. Comparing yourself to others leads to unempathetic behaviors. And envious actions, unempathetic behaviors lead to a lonely life.

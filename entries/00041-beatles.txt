I've had the Beatles on my mind recently thanks to the buzz around Peter Jackson's "[Link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles:_Get_Back]The Beatles: Get Back[/Link]" documentary.

I grew up long after the Beatles had broken up and I had never listened to a full Beatles album despite liking a lot of their songs. I decided to listen to every album in order, looking up interesting details about the albums and songs on Wikipedia along the way. (I wish there were more [Link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop-Up_Video]pop-up videos[/Link]!)

I now have a lot more appreciation for the Beatles members as people, how hard-working they were, and how their music evolved.

Here are my Beatles picks (in no particular order). Many of these songs are so popular that I already knew them; others I heard for the first time during this listen-through. I left off some songs (Hey Jude, Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds, and many more) that are objectively good but that I don't like enough to consider "my picks". Some of these songs are funny (such as Norwegian Wood, Michelle, Girl (how a pained John Lennon sucks in air through his teeth), Getting Better), some are just fun, and others are among the most beautiful songs I've ever heard.

Post-Beatles honorable mentions:

- John Lennon - How Do You Sleep?
- Paul McCartney - Maybe I'm Amazed
- Paul McCartney & Michael Jackson - Say Say Say
- Paul McCartney & Wings - Live and Let Die

I also watched the movies [Link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yesterday_(2019_film)]Yesterday[/Link] and [Link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Across_the_Universe_(film)]Across the Universe[/Link] and enjoyed them more than I could've if I hadn't heard these albums and learned some of the history beforehand.
